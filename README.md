# Kit

As the name suggests, this is a collection of browser tools — an ongoing personal toolkit.  
New tools may be added whenever I run into a problem worth solving. Basically, just simple tools for simple tasks.

I build these tools to scratch my own itches, and keep them simple on purpose.  
They’re made with plain HTML and hosted on GitHub Pages, so I don’t have to deal with npm, build steps, dependency upgrades, or heavy frameworks for small things.

If any of them happen to help you too, that’s awesome. Enjoy!

## How to use

You've got two ways to roll:

1. **Online**  
   Just click the [GitHub Pages link](https://lu7ue.github.io/kit/) (or check the "About" section) and use them directly in your browser.

2. **Offline**  
   Download or clone the whole repo and open `index.html` on your computer.  
   Everything works locally (though some tools might need internet access to fetch specific resources).
