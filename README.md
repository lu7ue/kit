Kit, as the name suggests, this is my personal collection of browser tools. Since they are built with simple HTML, you can just open and use them anywhere. I created these to solve my own little daily headaches: no npm, no deployment drama, and of course, no cost. If any of them happen to help you too, that's awesome!

You've got two ways to roll:

1. **Online**: Just click the [GitHub Pages link](https://lu7ue.github.io/kit/) (or check the "About" section) and use them directly in your browser.
2. **Offline**: Download/clone the whole repo and open `index.html` on your computer. Everything works locally (though some tools might need internet access to fetch specific resources)!

Basically, just simple tools for simple tasks. Enjoy!
